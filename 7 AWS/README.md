[AWS] Important Notes

## [Just AWS] 06. AWS Fundamentals

### AWS

On Demand, Pay as You Go, Delivered Over Internet,
to elimainated heavy lifted tasks
common areas-> storage, calculations, secure, automation, DB as service, DevOPs, ML, IoT, Identity Management, etc.

### What Is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

### AWS Infrastructure 
-> location by Latency (Speed) -> where your customers are
-> Cost varies with region
-> Compliance (govt laws)
-> Services (frequent brand new updates varies with locations)

collections of availabilites

### Sample app

loads -> Elastic Load Balancer -> distribute traffic -> elastic compute class (EC2 instances) 
EC2
-> Amazon simple store service (S3)
-> DynamoDB
-> RDS relational db server

### Compute Services on AWS
to power your business-> need compute capacity
flexibility you can run virtually any app in cloud 
container services 
-> Amazon Elastic Compute EC2


-> docker (elastic container serice) ECS
Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, high-performance container orchestration service that supports Docker containers. It allows you to run and scale containerized applications on AWS.
-> kubernetes () EKS
Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS) makes it straightforward to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications that use Kubernetes on AWS

AWS Fargate is a compute engine for Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS that allows you to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters

-> pure serverless solutions (AWS Lambda)
AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume there is no charge when your code isn't running

### Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
